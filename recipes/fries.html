                <h2>How to Cook:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick</li>
                    <li>Soak them in cold water for atleast an hour or overnight.(Longer=crispier fries)</li>
                    <li>Rinse them twice with cold water and pat them dry.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6minutes. Don't overcrowd them by placing too many at a time, they won't be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel.</li>
                    <li>Double fry the fries. Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup.</li>
                </ol>
